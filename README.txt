Someone has been posting messages as me spamming scam coins.

I don't have any bitcoin addresses associated with my
forum account but I have a pretty good history of posting,
especially about Ripple where I used to work. As you can
see from my GitHub account, I have made extensive contributions
to Ripple (I have since resigned from the company):

Here is one of my old posts showing my association with Beast and
my GitHub hosted website (vinniefalco.github.io):
